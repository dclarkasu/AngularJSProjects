# AngularJS Projects
### Daniel Clark

## Description
This repository contains practice exercises as well as fully-functional web applications built from back to front as an individual or in a team environment. The projects here display use of all the technologies learned during Skill Distillery's program from writing a database in SQL, mapping it with JPA, using Gradle dependency management, the Spring framework, Java, JS, RESTful practices, and more.

## Todo Project
The ngtodo project showcases the full spectrum of skills and technologies learned. Built on a simple MySQL database (ngtododb.sql), mapped with JPA annotations and dependencies managed by Gradle, this Spring/REST application uses and Angular front end to keep track and display a todo list with a small amopunt of bootstrap added. This is the first web app with security authentication by encrypting passwords with bcrypt and cookies.
